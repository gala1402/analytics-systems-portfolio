# Darshan Gala — Analytics & Applied AI Portfolio

Senior Data Analyst / Data Scientist with 7+ years of experience building
decision-grade analytics, experimentation frameworks, and applied AI solutions
across customer experience, lending, and financial services.

My work sits at the intersection of **analytics engineering, machine learning,
and GenAI-enabled decision systems** — with a strong emphasis on trust,
interpretability, and real business impact.

---

## 🔍 What I Focus On (2024–2026 Analytics Trends)
- **SQL-first analytics engineering** and metric governance
- **Applied machine learning** with interpretability (not black-box models)
- **GenAI in analytics workflows** (LLMs with guardrails, evaluation, and monitoring)
- **Experimentation & causal inference** for product and CX decisions
- **End-to-end ownership** from raw data → insight → executive action

Rather than dashboards in isolation, I build analytics systems that support
repeatable, high-stakes decisions.

---

## 🧠 Professional Background (Snapshot)
- Built and deployed **SQL + Python analytics pipelines** supporting GenAI-powered
  contact-center operations and customer compensation decisions
- Owned **forecasting, capacity modeling, and financial analytics** used by
  Operations and Finance leadership
- Designed **data quality, governance, and release processes** for executive
  reporting
- Delivered analytics that influenced **multi-million-dollar budget allocations,
  service recovery, and operational planning**

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. Customer Churn Prediction (SQL + ML)
**Repository:**  
👉 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/customer-churn-prediction

**Why it matters:**  
Churn modeling remains one of the most common — and most misused — applications
of ML in analytics.

**What I built:**  
An end-to-end churn prediction pipeline using SQL-based behavioral feature
engineering, Python data pipelines, and both interpretable (logistic regression)
and non-linear (XGBoost) models. Feature importance is explicitly extracted to
ensure outputs are actionable for retention strategy, not just predictive.

### 2. LLM-Powered Analytics Copilot (GenAI + Governance)
**Repository:**  
👉 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-analytics-copilot

**Why it matters:**  
“Chat with your data” is trending — but unsafe without metric governance and
validation.

**What I built:**  
A GenAI-enabled analytics copilot that converts natural-language questions into
**validated, governed SQL** using a metric layer, query validation, and result
summarization. Designed to prevent hallucinations and support trustworthy
self-serve analytics.

---

### 3. Causal Impact & Experimentation Analytics Platform
**Repository:**  
👉 https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/causal-impact-analytics

**Why it matters:**  
Modern product teams need **causal answers**, not just A/B test p-values.

**What I built:**  
An experimentation and causal inference framework implementing A/B testing,
CUPED variance reduction, difference-in-differences, and counterfactual impact
estimation to support confident product and CX decisions.

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
Across all projects, I prioritize:
- Clear problem framing before modeling
- SQL where data naturally lives
- Interpretable ML and explainable metrics
- Analytics systems that scale across teams
- Outputs that executives can trust and act on

Most projects are intentionally designed to resemble **internal analytics
platforms**, not academic exercises or tutorials.

---
